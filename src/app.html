%sveltekit.head% — This placeholder is where SvelteKit will inject:
  - <link> elements, such as CSS or font files.
  - <script> elements needed for the application.
  - <meta> tags for SEO, social media cards, etc.
  - Any content from <svelte:head> components in your Svelte files.

%sveltekit.body% — This is the main content of the page, dynamically injected by SvelteKit:
  - It includes the HTML structure for the specific page being rendered.
  - This content should be inside a <div> or other container element to ensure proper hydration and prevent issues with browser extensions or scripts that might inject elements into the DOM.

%sveltekit.assets% — This is a placeholder for the path to your static assets:
  - It typically points to a directory where your static files like images, CSS, and JS are stored.
  - If paths.assets is configured in your SvelteKit project, this placeholder will be replaced by the specified path.
  - If not specified, it defaults to a relative path based on paths.base.

%sveltekit.nonce% — This is used for Content Security Policy (CSP) nonces:
  - If you're using a CSP and need to add nonces to your <script> or <link> tags, SvelteKit can inject a nonce here.
  - This placeholder will be replaced with the actual nonce value.

%sveltekit.env.[NAME]% — This is a placeholder for environment variables:
  - Environment variables that start with the publicPrefix (usually PUBLIC_) can be injected into your HTML.
  - For example, %sveltekit.env.PUBLIC_API_URL% would be replaced by the value of the environment variable PUBLIC_API_URL.
  - If the environment variable isn't found, it will default to an empty string ('').
